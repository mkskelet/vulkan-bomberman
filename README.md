# vulkan-bomberman

## WARNING: UNFINISHED PROJECT
This project was made to learn more about rendering in Vulkan.
As I was porting the gameplay code from my old bomberman clone I have realized it's not reusable and can't be built upon
and for those reasons I have decided to stop the work on the port. I will continue working with Vulkan in making my own
game engine that could go public some time later.

## HOW TO COMPILE
Grab VS 2017 or higher and follow instructions on https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ to get SDK and header files needed to compile
the code. They are referenced in VulkanCore.h

## LICENSE
This code is garbage and therefore free for everyone. Feel free to look at the rendering code but I suggest you don't take
anything more from this project. It can be done much cleaner.
